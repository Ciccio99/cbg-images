					<span style='font-weight: 700;'>Carter Brown Grotta</span> from Wilton, Connecticut is interested in all things art, which informs photography and occupies his down time. He is a 4th-year student at RIT, pursuing a degree in Advertising Photography and a minor in Creative Writing. He has offered his photography services professionally since 2010. In that capacity, Grotta listens to clients in order to find creative and cost-effective solutions for their graphic needs. 
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
					Grotta has a strong aesthetic sense and interpersonal skills. A skilled collaborator who enjoys working in a group setting, Grotta’s adaptability has earned him the nickname, “MyGyver on the set.” While still a student, Grotta has had several valuable professional opportunities, including the chance to photograph products for Cynthia Alexander Designs and artwork from browngrotta arts and Donna Schneier Fine Arts and to assist in photographing locations and employees of Paige Electric, Inc. in Nebraska and New Jersey for corporate identity pieces. His photography has won three local and regional awards since 2011.

					Grotta grew up in a creative household, exposed to art and artists and interested in ceramics, writing, video and cooking. Early on he became fascinated by jewelry, not only collecting pieces but also creating and photographing them. A commission to photograph a contemporary jewelry collection lead to the publication of Grotta’s still life image of a brooch in Multiple Exposures: Jewelry and Photography, an exhibition catalogue for the Museum of Arts and Design, NY, NY (Officina Libraria, 2014). Grotta is also interested in portraiture and fashion, particularly capturing the micro expressions that make up the simplest emotion. His portrait of hip-hop musician Weston, appears on the cover of the artist's first cd, The Crown is for the Taking.

					Grotta learned technical skills from his father and mentor, Tom Grotta, a professional photographer, art publisher and graduate of RIT. The senior Grotta, owner and founder of browngrotta arts, a contemporary arts promotion business, taught his son a unique approach to photography, focusing on still life, rendered in a very minimalistic style, using Carter’s childhood home, an adapted 1895 horse barn, as a massive studio space. Grotta has continued his education formally, studying Lighting Techniques and Studio Portraiture with Lawrence Frank Photography in Connecticut and People Photography, Typography and Page Design, 2-D and 4-D Design, Elements of Advertising Photography, Elements of Fine Art Photography and Elements of Photojournalism and related courses at RIT.
